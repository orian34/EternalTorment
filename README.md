Copyright (C) 2025 orian34

Version 1.2

To use, place the dll into the plugins folder. Requires BepInEx 5 with ConfigManager.

# Eternal Torment

This makes every instance of damage instantly kill you. You have to do the game hitless, or die and retry until you do. Dying does not end the run.

Optional config:
Keep an amount of rosaries on death and gain some shards from breaking the cocoon. Uses max health as modifier (10 masks = 100% rosaries kept and 50 shards from the cocoon).

## Custom Masks

Adds a fitting custom mask texture. Requires Silksong Customizer.
